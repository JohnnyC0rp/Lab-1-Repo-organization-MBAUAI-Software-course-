# TODOs

- Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
- Export `OPENAI_API_KEY` and run the CLI to verify that receipt extraction works end-to-end.
- Create a public GitHub repo named `A1220-lab1-yourname`, add it as a remote, and push `main`.
- Open a PR for the `feat/sanity-checks` branch, get a classmate review, and merge after approval.
- Optional practice: implement `feat/expenses` and `feat/plot-by-category` branches.
